## Heuristics Run
To run the deterministic heuristics, run the file `heuristic_main.py` 
To run the stochastic heuristics, run the file `sto_heuristic_main.py` 

## MINLP Run
To run the deterministic MINLP, run the file `minlp_deter.py` 
To run the stochastic MINLP, run the file `minlp_sto.py` 

## Heuristics Algorithm
The heuristics algorithm is stored in the files under `heuristics/` folder.
The files are separated into deterministic and stochastic version, 
where the stochastic version reuses the base method in the deterministic version.

## Pre-Processing Logic
`atcs.py` is the main file used to process the given data and extract the desired values.
